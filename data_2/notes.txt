I changed the head of the snake to 3 but that didn't seem to help much.
I think this is because the snake needs enough data for each 
level (age ~ length ~ number of segments) so that for each level it knows
how to find the food and survive. Now I am just going to train the snake
on how to locate the food at level 1 to see if it makes a difference in the
first level at least.
