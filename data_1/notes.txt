Objects'representation in matrix is just like it is in the Dijkstra game:
snake, explosion -> 2, food -> 1, empty -> 0

I think the problem with this is that since the whole body and even the bombs 2s
in the matrix, it is difficult for the cnn model to differentiate which one is
head from the rest of the body (and even the bombs). Additionally, it would be
best to collect ample data on each level of the snake (level ~ length ~ age ~ number of segments)
